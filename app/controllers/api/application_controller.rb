    # When making POST, DELETE & PATCH requests to our
    # controllers, Rails requires that an authenticity token
    # is included as part of our params. Normally Rails
    # will add this to any form that generates form helper methods
    # i.e. form_with, form_for, form_tag. This prevents third parties
    # from making such requests to our Rails app. It's a security measure
    # that is unneccessary in the context of a Web API.
